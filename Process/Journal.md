# Week 5 - Game analysis

The game I chose to talk about is Super Mario Bros. 3 for the NES because I was obsessed with it when I was 11 and
I'm currently looking to buy a NES so I can play old games for nostalgia:')
<br> I decided to make a list of what I consider good and less good design elements in this game (I guess some of
it will sound very obvious since this is a very widely loved game after all but I'll try to find some more
niche elements):
<br> PROS:
- The levels are organized very neatly and give a nice sense of progression. I guess it's become pretty basic
by today's standards but that game was the first
Mario game to be organized into worlds with their own respective layouts, maps, visual theme and aesthetic, music, and levels.
Maybe I'm biased because I love 80s-90s games aesthetic but the layout of the maps look so neat with the little squares
for each level and the castle icons and the various mini-games/powerups
- The sound design is simple yet iconic
- I find that the new flying mecanic that comes with the racoon power up in this game is actually one of the coolest
features of this game. I love the arrows that fill up as you gather up speed and the beeping that indicates that you're going
fast enough to take flight. I also like that the beeping matches the controls for flying which is basically just rapidly
pressing a button for your life.
  
<br> CONS:
- I think the side-scrolling levels are often way too fast, which makes them literal hell.
- I find that a lot of the really interesting powerups (like the tanooki suit and frog suit)
are actually extremely scarce in the game, with very few rare occasions
to try them
- I actually refuse to believe that some of the levels in this game were properly tested, especially those in the later levels.
Two specific memories I have of ridiculous levels are:
1.  a haunted house in which the only way out was through a door hidden in a
random off-screen location such that the only way to find it was to randomly fly up every corner of the room (which was pretty
wide) until you find it.
2. the majority of levels in the pipe-themed world where you basically have to enter random
pipes over and over until you find the right combinason that brings you to the end, with most pipes actually leading you
back to the start of the level. Not cool nintendo>:(
- Also one thing I never understood about Mario games is how the points work. Everything you do gives you points but
then they are never used for anything. You don't need them to pass from one world to another. You can't buy powerups
or whatever with them. Update: I looked it up and apparently the scoring in the original Mario games was basically there
to make the player feel good when he or she gets a really big score even if it means nothing. Pretty funny methinks
