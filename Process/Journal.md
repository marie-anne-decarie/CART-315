# Week 9 - Prototyping

This week, the first thing I did was improve my paper prototype. As I mentioned, I didn't like the word bank I had and I also wanted to make it bigger. So, I went on the internet and searched for funny or unusual english words and managed to gather a pretty large bank of 50-ish nouns + 50-ish adjectives. It was a fun process and I'm much happier with the words I have now.<br>

<br> Then, I wanted to tackle coding. I started over with a new scene because my first attempt at a prototype from last week was not working at all. It still feels pretty incomplete, but with my level of skill I'm pretty satisfied with what I managed to achieve. Here's what you can do so far in my game:
- Get a random selection of nouns and adjectives
- Click on the nouns and adjectives to craft an insult. The words you click on are displayed on the screen
- When you click on the words, points are displayed on the screen
- There is an "attack" button that launches the attack, i.e. removes the words from the screen and calculate the final score. So far, there is no turns mechanic, so you can't actually attack another player.

<br> For this to feel really complete, I would have wanted to add a time limit for the attack as well as a turns mechanic so that two players can craft insults one after the other. For now, all I managed to do was have a button to reload the screen and thus allow for a new turn to start.
<br> For the specific rules, unfortunately, I still did not have the occasion to test this with actual people. I was really focused on the actual coding aspect (which always takes me the longest) and didn't invite other people to try the rules I had thought, so they might still need some tweaking. 

<br> For now, here are the notes I took this week in my notebook: <br>

# March 9th - Reflecting on this week's playtest

The playtest in class went pretty well! I didn't have a lot of time to actually test my game, but I showed the concept art and the paper prototype to other people and they said they liked the idea a lot. They already gave some suggestions to improve it, like make the words more unexpected and random as opposed to regular swear words/insult (which I totally agree with, I think the initial word bank I came up with ended up being way too reliant on those).
<br> I talked a bit about the turns mechanic as well. In my mind, both player would craft their attack at the same time from a shared words bank in a limited time, but someone proposed alternate turns instead, with a strict time limit. Each round, one player could attack first and the second gets a chance to defend themselves, or both pick a word each their turn until both attacks are ready. 
<br> One thing I was worried about is the fact that this game concept already exists. I talked about it with others and they didn't think it was a big deal, since knowing it already existed now, I could just get inspired from it and also make sure that mine was different enough to stand out. This reassured me and I will carry on with this project despite my initial concerns.
<br> For now, the first thing I want to do is improve the paper prototype (since the one I did was a bit minimalistic) and test it for a bit longer with my friends, since as I mentioned, we ran out of time in class to really test it well. After that, I'll try to start coding. I already tried making a Unity prototype last week, but it didn't go well at all and I didn't even show it in class. I think I definitely tried to go too fast. All I managed to do was shuffle the words from the bank and display a few of them in the right slots on screen. I think I can build up on this and make something really simple just to showcase how this game will be played.
<br> Going forward, the questions I'll try to answer are:
- What are the specific rules of this game (turns, points, how to win, etc.)?
- How can I make the wordbank funnier to more people and less reliant on offensive language?
- How to make a basic version of it in Unity without overcomplicating things?

<br><br> Here's what I had to show in class: <br>

<br> That's it for now!

# March 7th

*So, turns out my idea already exists...*
<br><br> I just showed my (very rough) prototype to my friend, and she goes "girl...that's already a thing..."
<br> I should have looked it up!:( <br>
![oh sir](https://github.com/marie-anne-decarie/CART-315/assets/157767089/0f6bbfce-5533-40e2-937e-4e19ec9ae6ac) <br>
Honestly these past two weeks have been a little rough. I tried to do too much and too fast. I wanted to get ahead and have a Unity prototype to show in class, but I really overestimated my coding skills and I wasn't able to do much except shuffle the words and show them on screen. At least I have some paper material, but again, the "the idea already exists now" thing really worries me. We'll see what happens when I show it in class!

# March 4th
<br><br> I've been thinking a bit more about the words fighting game. I think it could be really fun, even though I'm not entirely sure about the rules and gameplay.
<br> I realized I forgot to write actual design values like we discussed last week so here goes:
- Experience/emotion: This game has to be funny for the player(s). The game should be fast-paced enough to force the player to choose his words quickly and come up with something a little absurd, without too much overthinking. The game should also be just a tasteful amount of offensive (it is a fighting game, it needs a bit of violence, verbal in this case)
- Aesthetic: The way the game looks has to add to the comedy. I envision comical animations when the avatar attacks or receives an attack. I like the idea of the characters literally throwing physical words or speech bubbles at each other (it reminds me a little of something they do in the animated show Tuca and Bertie, where a character will say something and literal letters will come out of their mouth and interact with the environment). The color palette should also be bright and eye-catching, as far from boring as possible!

<br><br> Problem statement: How can I make the concept of cards against humanity into a 1v1 street-fighter-type game?

# Reading week (6.5? 7?) - Ideation process

**February 29** <br>
<br> I've been thinking a lot about game ideas these past few days and I couldn't really find anything that stuck, but then suddenly last night at 2AM my brain started working again!! I have plenty of inspiration now!
<br> I realized that I was feeling super bored lately and I got the idea of making a game both *about* boredom and that helps *fight* (or perhaps *embrace*) it. I made a mind map: <br> <br>
![boredomMindMap](https://github.com/marie-anne-decarie/CART-315/assets/157767089/2e71cc51-d6f9-4d0b-88f4-d220b65d19c2)
The actual notes I took on my phone at 2AM: <br>
![2AM notes](https://github.com/marie-anne-decarie/CART-315/assets/157767089/e09a65f4-516e-4efc-8f80-20a4e12f1af2)
<br>(the words fighting game doesn't quite work with this theme and it's less funny now than it was in my head 10 hours ago
but still... I think it has potential. I'll get back to it later!)<br>
Back to the boredom idea, I don't just want to make a game to play *when you're bored* (which there are already tons of), but rather one that explores boredom and other related things as central thematics and where the goal is explicitely to exploit boredom in a playful way, perhaps still making you waste your time, but with self-awareness!

<br><br> Mecanic ideas that play with boredom, time perception and procrastination:
- Time manipulation: certain actions make time in the game advance slower or faster
- The game gives you tasks and the goal is to complete as little as possible
- A survival game and the thing that is trying to kill you is the deadline/ your responsibilities
- A daydreaming mode where time is stretched and everything becomes aesthetically brighter and more colorful

<br> CONCRETE IDEAS:
1. **Bore me: a game to waste time on purpose**. You click the "bore me" button and it generates a series of mini-games that you can play to pass time. The mini-games are all based around the theme of procrastination, fidget toys and stupid things you do when you're bored. Perhaps it starts with a few questions like "how easily are you bored" and "how long do you want to be bored for" and then craft a personalized series of mini-games for you. At the end, you chose between "I'm bored now" and "Bore me again". It's partly inspired by this website that takes you to a random useless website every time you click the button: [theuselessweb](https://theuselessweb.com/), except with games instead of websites and some level of customization. 
2. **Daydream Disaster** (working title) A game about escapism from reality and distorted perceptions of time. There's a progress bar that fills up as you get closer and closer to a deadline. The goal is to push it back for as long as possible by playing different tasks/mini-games that make time slower. The most efficient methods to waste time also give you the most psychic damage. The UI ressembles a phone or desktop with apps and notifications (game examples: *A Normal Lost Phone*, *Simulacra*) 
3. **Words fight**. This idea is quite different from everything I talked about so far but I still think it's worth writing down! It's a 1v1 fighting game that uses words and speech bubbles instead of weapons, with a Cards Against Humanity-like mecanic. You craft your 'weapons' by filling the blanks in a sentence, creating the most creative/shocking/offensive insult or comeback as possible. The most shocking or funny your words, the more it hurts your opponent. I have no idea how the points system work as of right now. In CAH, there's always a neutral person that judges who picked the funniest card, but in this game, perhaps the judge is the computer, or each word option comes with a pre-established amount of points and combining certain words cause more damage, and there's joker cards where the player can craft his or her own witty comeback to attack the opponent. I guess that's the design goal here: making a game that adapts a CAH-type game into a 1v1 fighting mode.
![words fight sketch](https://github.com/marie-anne-decarie/CART-315/assets/157767089/0eaa0c59-8ce2-440b-b57b-df2cf89aced1)
<br> Back to the points system: maybe the game has some predefined words that are worth a certain numbers of points, but then there's a bunch of customizable cards and the players basically build their own set of words before the game start based on what they think is funny. There would be some guidelines, like "write the uggliest thing possible" or "your favorite insult" or "a very shocking adjective" or whatever. So the game takes care of the mecanical/points-counting part but the players are responsible for building the creative/humoristic part.  





# Week 5 - Game analysis

The game I chose to talk about is Super Mario Bros. 3 for the NES because I was obsessed with it when I was 11 and
I'm currently looking to buy a NES so I can play old games for nostalgia:')
<br> I decided to make a list of what I consider good and less good design elements in this game (I guess some of
it will sound very obvious since this is a very widely loved game after all but I'll try to find some more
niche elements):
<br> PROS:
- The levels are organized very neatly and give a nice sense of progression. I guess it's become pretty basic
by today's standards but that game was the first
Mario game to be organized into worlds with their own respective layouts, maps, visual theme and aesthetic, music, and levels.
Maybe I'm biased because I love 80s-90s games aesthetic but the layout of the maps look so neat with the little squares
for each level and the castle icons and the various mini-games/powerups
- The sound design is simple yet iconic
- I find that the new flying mecanic that comes with the racoon power up in this game is actually one of the coolest
features of this game. I love the arrows that fill up as you gather up speed and the beeping that indicates that you're going
fast enough to take flight. I also like that the beeping matches the controls for flying which is basically just rapidly
pressing a button for your life.
  
<br> CONS:
- I think the side-scrolling levels are often way too fast, which makes them literal hell.
- I find that a lot of the really interesting powerups (like the tanooki suit and frog suit)
are actually extremely scarce in the game, with very few rare occasions
to try them
- I actually refuse to believe that some of the levels in this game were properly tested, especially those in the later levels.
Two specific memories I have of ridiculous levels are:
1.  a haunted house in which the only way out was through a door hidden in a
random off-screen location such that the only way to find it was to randomly fly up every corner of the room (which was pretty
wide) until you find it.
2. the majority of levels in the pipe-themed world where you basically have to enter random
pipes over and over until you find the right combinason that brings you to the end, with most pipes actually leading you
back to the start of the level. Not cool nintendo>:(
- Also one thing I never understood about Mario games is how the points work. Everything you do gives you points but
then they are never used for anything. You don't need them to pass from one world to another. You can't buy powerups
or whatever with them. Update: I looked it up and apparently the scoring in the original Mario games was basically there
to make the player feel good when he or she gets a really big score even if it means nothing. Pretty funny methinks
